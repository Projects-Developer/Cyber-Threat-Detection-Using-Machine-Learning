## Abstract: 
Cyber threat detection is a critical component of modern cybersecurity systems. Traditional signature-based detection methods are ineffective against zero-day attacks and advanced persistent threats. This paper proposes a machine learning-based approach for cyber threat detection. Our approach uses a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms to detect anomalies in network traffic. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in detecting cyber threats with high accuracy.
